Lilly is a little girl impatient to grow up. Pretending to be big, however, creates complications as her imagination runs away with her. 
Behind the fanciful verse of I Am Lilly is an important message about how children develop a sense of self. 
The discovery of who we are begins in the hearts and minds of children, and in changing times like ours, that inner foundation becomes even more essential. 
I Am Lilly presents these ideas about identity in a playful way reminiscent of Dr. Seuss. 
As a psychoanalyst and poet as well as author/illustrator, Annie Reiner illuminates this process of growth in a book that is fun for children and adults. 
Her unique paper cut-out illustrations add child-like spontaneity and humor to Lilly s journey.
